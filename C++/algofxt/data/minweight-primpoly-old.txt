# Minimal weight primitive polynomials over GF(2)
# taken from the paper
#    K. Cattell, J. Muzio:
#   "Tables of linear cellular automata for minimal weight
#    primitive polynomials of degrees up to 300"
#
# Note that the minweight polynomials given here are do not have the
# additional lowbit property (highest non-zero entry as far right as
# possible, given in minweight-primpoly.txt).
# e.g. for degree==30 (weight=5):
#  0x40018003UL == 30,16,15,1,0 // minweight entry (this file)
#  0x40000053UL == 30,6,4,1,0   // minweight-lowbit entry
#.
