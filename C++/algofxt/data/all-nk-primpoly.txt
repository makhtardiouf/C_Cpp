#
# Primitive polynomials x^k + (1+x)^n over GF(2) for n<=400
#
# An entry n,k,0 means x^k + (1+x)^n is primitive.
# All entries n,*,* correspond to polynomials of degree n, i.e. 0<k<n
# Whenever there is an entry n,k,0 then there is also an entry n,n-k,0
# (for the reciprocal polynomial).
# Also both (1+x)^k + x^n and (1+x)^(n-k) + x^n are irreducible.
