Daniel loves graphs. He thinks a graph is special if it has the following properties:

It is undirected.
The length of each edge is 11.
It includes exactly PP different lovely triplets.
A triplet is a set of 33 different nodes. A triplet is lovely if the minimum distance between each pair of nodes in the triplet is exactly QQ. Two triplets are different if 11 or more of their component nodes are different.

Given PP and QQ, help Daniel draw a special graph.

Input Format

A single line containing 22 space-separated integers, PP (the number of different lovely triplets you must have in your graph) and QQ (the required distance between each pair of nodes in a lovely triplet), respectively.

Constraints

1≤P≤5000
2≤Q≤9
Output Format

For the first line, print 22 space-separated integers, NN (the number of nodes in the graph) and MM (the number of edges in the graph), respectively. 
On each line ii of the MM subsequent lines, print two space-separated integers, uiui and vivi, describing an edge between nodes uiui and vivi.

Your output must satisfy the following conditions:

0 ≤ N, M ≤ 100
1 ≤ ui, vi ≤N
If there is more than one correct answer, print any one of them.

Explanation

There are exactly P=3P=3 lovely triplets in this graph: {1,3,5}{1,3,5}, {2,4,6}{2,4,6}, and {2,6,7}{2,6,7}. tripletex.png Observe that each node in a lovely triplet is Q=2Q=2 edges away from the other nodes composing the lovely triplet.
